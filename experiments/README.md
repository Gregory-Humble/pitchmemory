# Experiment Map

For multi experiment projects, it's important to keep track of what each of the
experiments was, when they took place, etc. This readme should explain all this.

There should be one folder per experiment, and they should be named according to
a standard scheme. If there is an experiment called "urntask" then the corresponding
folder should be called `exp_urntask` (it should contain three subfolders, which
should always be called `data`, `source` and `other`).
